# Verifiable Computing Using Computation Fingerprint Within FHE

This is a sample repository, implementing 3 code examples survyed in the VC-FHE article

  - Impossibility LUT ([HELib](https://github.com/homenc/HElib))
  - Basic Fingerprint ([Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL))
  - SIMD Fingerprint ([Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL))

The code samples are using FHE, and supplement with an output file.

For more information about the techniques used and their benfits, read the article.
