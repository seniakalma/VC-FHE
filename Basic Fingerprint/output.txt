|         VC-FHE example, F(x, y) = (2 * X) + y + 3         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
Our fingerprint values are F(3, 2) = 11
Each part(side) has 6 bits allocated,

Enter 2 values:
4
7

We expect to get the fingerprint value of F(3, 2) = 11 at the LSB side
We expect to get the user result of       F(4, 7) = 18 at the MSB side
18 left shifted by 6 is 186
After positioning the input values (4, 7) at Lsh 6 along with the fingerprint (3, 2) we get:
=X IS: 259       binary: 000100 | 000011
=Y IS: 450       binary: 000111 | 000010

-Calculating (2*X)
2 * X VC is: 518
-Calculating Y + 3
         Encrypted 450 will be added 3 and (3 Lsh 6) => +(3) +(192)
         450 + 195= 645
Y VC + 3 is: 645
-Calculating (2*X) + Y+3
(2*X) + Y+3 is: 1163
## The final result is: 1163
010010 | 001011
MSB side is: 18 | LSB side is: 11
We have recieved the correct result of the calculation of 18 at the left part !
We have recieved the expected result of the fingerprint of 11 at the right part !
